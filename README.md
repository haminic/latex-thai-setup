# $\LaTeX$ Thai Setup

## ‚ñ∏ About üìñ

This repository contains a simple $\LaTeX$ setup for **Thai documents**, featuring a quick preamble and an example document. This setup is based on the preamble I personally use in my own $\LaTeX$ documents, with some modifications to make it easier to modify, and more suitable for general use. 

Feel free to use or modify this setup for your own documents. The included example document (source code at [`main.tex`](main.tex), as well as the [compiled PDF](main.pdf)) demonstrates basic usage, including common commands for formatting and equations.

## ‚ñ∏ How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è

- Copy the entire [`preamble.tex`](preamble.tex) file, put it in your document's root directory, and follow the first few lines in the [example document](main.tex). Alternatively, you can copy the content of the preamble directly into your document‚Äôs main file if you prefer.
- Don't forget to set your compiler to $\XeLaTeX$.
